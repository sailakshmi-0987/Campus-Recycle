# 🌿 Campus Recycle – Your College Mini Marketplace

> “Why throw away, when someone next door may need it?”

## 📌 Overview

**Campus Recycle** is a peer-to-peer web app built with the **MERN Stack (MongoDB → Supabase version)** that helps students **share, exchange, or donate** items they no longer need — directly within their campus community.  
It promotes **sustainability, reusability, and student collaboration** while using **Supabase** for backend database and authentication.

## 💡 The Problem

Many students have unused items — books, gadgets, clothes, furniture, stationery.  
These often end up collecting dust or being discarded, while others spend money buying similar items.

## 🌍 Our Solution

Campus Recycle connects students in a **safe and trusted campus network** to:
- 📸 **Post** items they no longer need.
- 🔍 **Browse** available items by category.
- 🤝 **Request** and **exchange** items directly with others.
- 🌱 **Reduce waste** and promote sustainability through reusing.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology Used |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js, Tailwind CSS / Material UI |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage) |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth |
| **Storage** | Supabase Storage (for images) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel / Render / Netlify |

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ **Post Items** — Upload photos, add description, and specify category & location.  
- 🔍 **Browse Items** — Filter by type (books, gadgets, clothes, etc.).  
- 💬 **Request System** — Request and manage item requests securely.  
- 👥 **User Authentication** — Sign up, log in, and manage profiles with Supabase Auth.  
- 🔔 **Real-time Updates** — Instant item listing and request synchronization.  
- ♻️ **Eco-Friendly Initiative** — Encourages recycling & sharing within the campus.


## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Post Your Item**  
   Upload a photo, add a short description, and set a pickup location.

2. **Browse & Request**  
   Explore the campus marketplace by category or keyword.

3. **Direct Exchange**  
   Connect with the student directly — no middleman or fees.

4. **Sustainable Impact**  
   Reduce waste and help build a circular campus economy.
